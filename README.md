PredAR is a native Android prototype application developed as part of my masterâ€™s dissertation in 2020. Its purpose is to serve as an educational companion app specifically designed to understand in what capacity are AR experiences suitable for classroom use.

For its creation, I used the following:
- ARCore SDK for augmented reality features
- Google Clout Anchors and Firebase services for the multiplayer component
- MVVM architecture
- Kotlin
- Android Studio
